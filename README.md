# ANAMOLY_DETECTION_IN_WATER_PURIFICATION_SYSTEM

Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in water purification systems, where Sensor failures can result in poor performance of the system and water quality. 
This project focuses on the detection of anomalies in sensor streams based on machine learning and analytics with.
 This would be the objective of predictive maintenance solutions. By identifying sensor failures early, this approach minimizes system downtime and reduces maintenance costs.
This project will also review the ability of predictive maintenance on overall system reliability and operational efficiency.
The results demonstrate the potential of advanced anomaly detection to improve system performance and ensure consistent water quality in purification processes.
